# SDN-enabled Resource Provisioning Framework for Geo-Distributed Streaming Analytics

This repository contains the code used in [SAFA], which was accepted at [ACM TOIT'22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3571158).

## What can I find in this repo?

* `code/Python` contains DCM and ECM selection algorithms of SAFA implemented in Python.
We have used this implementation to evaluate the worker node selection algorithms of SAFA on three different real-world topologies when running the extended version of the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark [YSB](https://github.com/dataArtisans/yahoo-streaming-benchmark). We used this code for the evaluation in Section 7.4. 

* `code/P4` contains the P4_16 code SAFA on programmable switches.<br/>
